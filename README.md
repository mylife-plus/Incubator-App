# Incubator-App
### with this app users can incubate mylife+ projects

- user clicks on "start new project" (breed a penguin)
- now s/he writes the project idea into the app (describe penguins look, behaviour, skills etc.)
- once finished s/he proposes the project idea (Penguin description) to the governance app (osmo.dao) where MOOS token holder vote on it.  
- if a project idea get approved, it moves into the projects lab.
- in the lab s/he chooses a milestone+issue template (penguin DNA blueprint)
- s/he edits the milestone/issues to fit to the project (edit penguin DNA blueprint).
- when finished with the first milestone/issues (first DNA segment) s/he proposes the milestone/issues to the governance app (osmo.dao) where MOOS token holder vote on the milestone. 
- if approved the milestone/issues get sent to the bounty app where devs bid on the issues. 
- now MOOS holder vote which devs to select. 
- when devs are selected the issues get converted into bounties.
- now the choosen devs can work on the bounty and once finished send the code to the project. 
- there a new review bounty gets automatically generated and Breeder (osmos.dao aproved devs who stake min. 100$ in MOOS) can now review the code (finished DNA segment) and get rewarded with project tokens.
- once the code gets approved MOOS equal to the bounties $value gets minted and deposited into the project token bonding curve, where new project tokens get minted and distributed to the user who completed the bounty.
- when all Level 1 (Incubation) milestones are finished the beta version 0 get shipped (1.Stage: Penguin gets bred in Incubator - DNA editing is finished and the in vitro fertillisation process starts first 2 month) 
- now the project has to go to all the beta versions (0-2) unitl it reaches the alpha version 0 (penguin hatches)
- at this stage the project leaves the incubator (Penguin leaves the incuabtor)
